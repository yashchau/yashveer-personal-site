# Project History Log

Chronological notes that help future collaborators and agents understand what shipped, why it mattered, and what is
still on deck.

## 2025-09-16
- Added dedicated `/ventures` route with updated styling so current companies are surfaced alongside a CTA for contact.
- Launched `/blog` index and the inaugural post “The Knowledge Connection Vision,” including structured sections and a
  warm not-found/loader experience.
- Refreshed layout navigation (glass pill nav with active-state highlighting), tightened global spacing, introduced a
  subtle background gradient, and polished cards (venture contact fix, footer glass shell).
- Created this history log to make context discoverable for all agents.

**Outstanding focus areas**
- Flesh out additional venture content (metrics, progress updates) and supporting imagery.
- Expand the blog system (RSS, channel filters, additional posts, MDX pipeline) to keep thought leadership rolling.
- Implement mobile navigation pattern and evaluate Supabase integration path for live content.
